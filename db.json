Recently restored balance literally pivots on a point - boat rocking is discouraged. But we&rsquo;ve forgotten how to communicate, we&rsquo;ve forgotten what truth is. Most of us.<\/p>\r\n<p>Sweet Rock C&aacute;ll is a digital theatre piece staged across three countries. Technology allows us to do this, but technology can be hacked, and even a live audience (like you) watching a theatre show might find themselves involved, thus deciding the fate of the world as we know it.<\/p>\r\n<p>Something has to give, and someone has to take it.<\/p>\r\n<p>The alternative is to lose everything.<\/p>\r\n<p>Presented by The Spontaneous Theatre People, Sweet Rock C&aacute;ll is a multi-media, multi-lingual piece with performers from Ireland, Poland, Germany (and one undisclosed location). Written by &Oacute;rla Mc Govern, and based on work from the ensemble, it will be broadcast digitally with live performers, and audience engagement will be encouraged. Featuring &Oacute;rla Mc Govern, Ilka Luza, Kasia Chmara and Niceol Blue.<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p><img id=\"dragon\" src=\"\/shows\/2021\/4\/Banner-Dragon.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<h3 class=\"gtf\"><small>Fizz and Chips Productions<\/small><br \/>DRAGON <a class=\"gtfbuy\" href=\"https:\/\/tht.ticketsolve.com\/shows\/1173610219\/events\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Buy Tickets<\/a><\/h3>\r\n<p class=\"gtfinfo\">May 6th - 8th* (*8th May post show Q&amp;A) \/ 8pm \/ 60mins \/ Online \/ 12+ \/ &euro;10<br \/><small>If you are watching with a group, please consider purchasing a group ticket for &euro;15<br \/><\/small><\/p>\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"columns small-12 large-12 p20\">\r\n<p>\"Can monsters ever change?

As the caf&eacute;s and girls change, the story he tells remains the same: the mythical tale of an all-powerful dragon. This world becomes illuminated before our very eyes as the focus shifts to the dragon, terrorizing a village of defenseless civilians. But perhaps this story tells us more about the present than any fantasy world...<\/p>\r\n<p>Exploring the mythology of masculinity, Fizz &amp; Chips will take you on this journey through music, movement, laughter and tears.<\/p>\r\n<p>Supported by The Arts Council of Ireland, Fringe Lab, Kildare County Council, Smock Allies Scene and Heard and UNESCO<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p><img id=\"thecommongood\" src=\"\/shows\/2021\/4\/Banner-TheCommonGood.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<h3 class=\"gtf\"><small>Eileen Gibbons<\/small><br \/>The Common Good <a class=\"gtfbuy\" href=\"https:\/\/tht.ticketsolve.com\/shows\/1173610223\/events\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Buy Tickets<\/a><\/h3>\r\n<p class=\"gtfinfo\">May 2nd &amp; 3rd \/ 1pm \/ 55 - 70 mins \/ Online \/ &euro;5<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"columns small-12 large-12 p20\">\r\n<p>An invitation to get involved<\/p>\r\n<p>As a result of pitching this idea at ITI&rsquo;s Prime Platform (supported by Age &amp; Opportunity) in November 2019 Eileen was invited to become an associate artist with axis: Ballymun in January 2020, as well as receiving funding from Galway County Council.

Escapism is a very necessary pursuit right now, and Fever Dreams follows it to mesmerising effect. It works like all the best records - it becomes a mode of transport; it picks you up from where you are and sets you down elsewhere. Coinciding with the announcement, O&rsquo;Brien has also shared the first song from the forthcoming album, &ldquo;The First Day&rdquo;. It was inspired by a trip to the fabled Another Love Story festival in County Meath &ndash; beginning as a snatched electronic doodle, it morphed into a widescreen, lushly cinematic evocation of the joy in human connection.<\/p>\r\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/MRbKAsBOamY\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\r\n<p>Director Daniel Brereton says of the video &ldquo;The whole process was pretty collaborative with Conor. I think we both imagined a floatiness to the video, and obviously the title conjures up a lot of imagery and ideas, &lsquo;The first day of the rest of your life&rsquo;. What does that look like? How does that feel? We were very lucky to shoot on film and have great casting and styling. Shooting during a pandemic is not easy, so I feel fortunate that we got to make it happen.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>O&rsquo;Brien says on the gestation of Fever Dreams: &ldquo;I had an urge to write something that was as generous to the listener as it was to myself. Sometimes the most delirious states can produce the most ecstatic, euphoric and escapist dreams.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>These are songs with the strange, melted shapes and the magical ambivalence of dreams. The intent of the songs is both mysterious and as clear as a bell. With Fever Dreams, there is a sense of a deepening mastery and an expanding reach by O&rsquo;Brien. Inspiration for the album was found in many places and came in from all angles, from night swimming on a Dutch island to Flann O&rsquo;Brien, Audre Lorde, David Lynch, L. S. Lowry via the library music of Piero Umiliani and Alessandro Alessandroni and jazz from Duke Ellington and Alice Coltrane.<\/p>\r\n<p>Written over the course of two years, the main bodies of the songs were recorded in a series of full-band studio sessions in late 2019 and early 2020. During the long, slow pandemic days, O&rsquo;Brien refined them in his tiny home studio in Dublin, and the album was then mixed by David Wrench (Frank Ocean, The xx, FKA Twigs).<\/p>\r\n<p>Alongside the album announcement, Villagers have confirmed a string of live dates for later this year taking in the UK and Ireland.<\/p>\r\n<p>Fever Dreams follows The Art Of Pretending To Swim, Darling Arithmetic, {Awayland} and Becoming A Jackal. Conor O&rsquo;Brien also has a string of accolades under his belt including two Ivor Novello Awards, two Mercury Music Prize nominations and is a previous winner of Ireland&rsquo;s Choice Music Prize. Additionally, Villagers&rsquo; music has featured in the BBC\/Hulu series Normal People and their Spotify session of &ldquo;Nothing Arrived&rdquo; has hit over 165 million streams.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Standing Concert<\/strong><\/p>",

John Kane is sitting on a hospital gurney, and very shortly a jazz percussionist, two women called Mary, a very old man and a giant lobster will arrive.<\/p>\r\n<p>Then everything will start.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Galway International Arts Festival<\/strong> and <strong>Landmark Productions<\/strong> are partnering once more to bring to the stage a <strong>new play<\/strong> by <strong>Enda Walsh<\/strong>. Medicine will receive its world premiere performance at the prestigious Edinburgh International Festival in August prior to its opening at GIAF 2021 in September. Medicine is the latest co-production from Landmark and GIAF the team who brought you Walsh&rsquo;s Misterman, Ballyturk and Arlington.<\/p>\r\n<p>Medicine is a dark and frequently absurdist work that shatters the boundary between cast and audience: actors are interrupted by crew members, technical mechanics happen on stage, and performance becomes a kind of therapy. The audience&rsquo;s laughter becomes complicit in the creation of a surreal universe that shifts abruptly into moments of emotional poignancy.

A revolution in rock and pop brought us The Beatles, Elvis, and the Rolling Stones, while here in Ireland the magnificent showband boom was about to explode. A young man growing up at that time, Declan was being heavily influenced by these greats and indeed was getting the rare opportunity to see most of the top showbands appear in his native town of Drumlish. He would cajole his mother into seeing Joe Dolan, Big Tom, Philomena Begley, The Capital Showband, and many more perform when they appeared at the marquee at the end of May and early June. From his vantage point close to the stage, he would absorb every move made by the guitarist in the bands, watching his fingers slide along the strings, hoping that one day he might be up there performing just like Dan O&rsquo;Hara or Seamus McMahon.<\/p>\r\n<p><iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/cejoEySLecs\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\r\n<p>Declan has went on to have a super career that has spanned over 4 decades at the top of Irish Country Music winning many accolades along the way and scoring countless hits with his catalogue of trademark song.

Joanne owns nothing and has birthed nothing and despite some ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE (incredibly minor) comedic achievements, her mother is still trying to convince her to go back and study nursing. Due to her thirties age box, Joanne spends her weekends celebrating other people&rsquo;s milestones at their garden parties drinking prosecco out of jam jars.<\/p>\r\n<p>She is full of questions, her main one being if she doesn&rsquo;t have a child, who will be obligated to watch her die so she doesn&rsquo;t have to do it alone? She&rsquo;s a people&rsquo;s person, she&rsquo;s just not sure she&rsquo;s a raising people&rsquo;s person. And what if she doesn&rsquo;t marry anyone. Is she prepared to face her biggest fear of being buried with her mother? And once her mother reads this, will she retract her offer?<\/p>\r\n<p>Joanne tackles the trials and tribulations of modern life with hilarious, charming, irreverence. Joanne wants you to know that she wrote this herself but stands by the previous line 100%.<\/p>\r\n<p>Age recommendation: 16+<\/p>\r\n<p>Running time 120 MINS | INCL. INTERVAL<\/p>",
